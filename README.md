A macOS app to open a URL in a new window. The Mac's default is to open it in a new tab.

The first time you open this app, it should ask for necessary permssions. The app then quits doing nothing.
Once you register this app as the default web browser, clicking a URL should open this app, which then redirects the URL to Safari.
