A macOS app to open a URL from non-browser apps in a new Safari window. The Mac's default is to open it in a new *tab*.

The first time you open this app, it should ask for necessary permssions. The app then quits doing nothing.
Once you set these permissions (most importantly, registering this app as your default web browser), clicking a URL should open this app, which then immediately redirects the URL to Safari.
